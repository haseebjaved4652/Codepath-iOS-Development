### Notes

I encountered how to manage github properly. It turned out to be that I can not push all of my xcode file to the local repo so i had to manage that. Another conflict that occured as it occurs to every beginner is to get to know SWIFT

### Notes

I recieved few challenges:
  (i) Creating a Cocoa Touch Class File, where I created a wrong subclass, thus unable to connect custom class 
  (ii) Created a tab bar controller instead of navigation controller
